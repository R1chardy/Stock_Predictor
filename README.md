# Stock_Predictor
This stock predictor scrapes everyday articles and news of stocks from wesites and organizations like Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg and analyzes the sentiment of stock using a trained neural network. Then, using the data and analysis from the scraped articles, we are able to give a prediction on what stock the media is saying will do well in the coming days/weeks/months as well as stocks to watch out for.
Project worked on by Brian Fu, Richard Yuan, and William Chu.
